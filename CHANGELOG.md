# Changelog

Versions are those in `pyproject.toml`; none is published to PyPI yet.

## 0.11.0 -- 2026-10-08
- `add_chart` makes a radar chart (`kind="radar"`, `edit_chart`'s `chart_type`), as
  PowerPoint and Word insert one (measured): lines in the accents, the column chart's axes.
- `legend="default"` (now the default) puts the legend where Office does: at the bottom,
  a radar chart's at the top.

## 0.10.0 -- 2026-10-08
- SmartArt model ids are made from the edit, so the same additions give the same bytes.
- `list_documents` removed from the shared tools.

## 0.9.0 -- 2026-10-07
- `charts.create.add_chart`: a new chart from data, written with a matching embedded workbook.
- `edit_chart` gains add, show/hide data labels and gap width; `GraphicHost.look` gives new
  titles and data labels the application's measured sizes.

## 0.8.0 -- 2026-10-07
- Required properties listed first, so strict decoding cannot drop an optional one.
- An array argument written as a JSON string is parsed (batch's ops); `\v` inside a JSON
  string reads as a line break.
- `open_document` on a text input points to `read_blob`.

## 0.7.0 -- 2026-10-07
- `Tool.reads`: a changing tool's reading mode runs as a read.
- Online checks for the workspace header and deferred tools found by tool search.

## 0.6.0 -- 2026-10-07
- Non-core tools deferred by default; strict on writing tools first; `allowed_tools`.
- Shorter shared descriptions, and a system prompt covering planning and batching.

## 0.5.0 -- 2026-10-07
- `read_blob`: an input's text (CSV, Markdown, plain text) a page at a time.
- A batch that changes nothing records no undo step and keeps the version.

## 0.4.0 -- 2026-10-07
- Shared tool definitions, refs (`$name`) and a generic `batch` tool.

## 0.3.0 -- 2026-10-06
- `ooxml_edit.tools`, the plumbing of an agent tool layer; `History.version`.

## 0.2.2 -- 2026-10-06
- `Chart.workbook_values()` reads a chart's workbook back; `content_types_with()` writes a
  copy with a part retyped.

## 0.2.1 -- 2026-10-04
- A new title keeps its language; a new series gets a `c16:uniqueId`.

## 0.2.0 -- 2026-10-04
- The optional `ooxml_edit.charts` subpackage: charts, embedded workbooks and SmartArt.

## 0.1.1 -- 2026-10-04
- `[Content_Types].xml` kept as Word writes it; an emptied relationships part is removed;
  `insert_in_order` attaches a detached child where no order is known.

## 0.1.0 -- 2026-10-03
- First release: the format-neutral core extracted from pptx-agent with its history --
  lossless OPC packages, adding, copying, removing and reaping parts, embedded packages,
  schema-ordered insertion, undo and redo, extension-list stamps. CI on three systems.
